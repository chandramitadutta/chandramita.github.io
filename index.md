Let’s try this out.

Welcome to my studio: a place where things may be incomplete, sometimes incoherent, and here simply because they struck a chord with me.

There are no fixed themes here. Or maybe there are. For once, I don’t want to organize, explain, or make anything presentable — just to put it out there.

Like an artist’s studio.

A visitor might walk in without invitation, but is welcome all the same.
